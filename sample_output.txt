Good evening 
This is the 37th time I have made considerable progress
in battling COVID-19. When I became President, about 2 million Americans who have failed to get the shot.

We have consistently condemned the violence on both sides has been Iran's past sponsorship of international terrorism. Iranian policy has been devoted to expelling all Western influence from the summer, only one of out of every 160,000 fully vaccinated Americans was hospitalized for COVID per day.
These are the facts.
